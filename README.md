# PaperPirate
A small 3D game made in Unity and C#.

You are now a pirate captain of a small ship set to loot every vessel in the bay. But beware, some ships are bigger than others. Controll your ship with the WASD keys.
Fire left with Mouse1 and right with mouse 2. To regain some lost hit-points, find paper scraps floating in the water.
Good luck 'mon capitaine'!
